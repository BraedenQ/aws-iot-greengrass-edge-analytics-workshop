## IOT-405R - Performing Analytics at the Edge with AWS IoT Greengrass

Workshop to showcase how to perform IoT data analytics at the edge using
AWS IoT Greengrass.

Industry 4.0 increasingly requires edge-centric analytics on telemetry data
generated from machines and devices; for example, edge-based ML inferencing,
and low-latency applications. In this workshop, you learn what it takes to
build an edge-based analytics cache engine to support time-series processing
functions, such as rolling statistics, and industrial-focused custom
calculations, such as bursts of rotational telemetry metrics.
